### Hi there üëã

I'm Carlton Gibson. I work mainly on and with the Django web framework. 

Between 2018 and the end of March 2023 I was a **Django Fellow**, and I've spent over a decade maintaining some of the key packages in the Django ecosystem. 

I have [a blog on my website](https://noumenal.es/), and together with @wsvincent co-host the [Django Chat podcast](https://djangochat.com). 

I've given lots of talks, most recently at DjangoCon Europe, 2023:

Enjoy! üçø

I'm currently working on [Neapolitan](https://github.com/carltongibson/neapolitan), [`django-template-partials`](https://github.com/carltongibson/django-template-partials), and (_at last!_) [Button](https://btn.dev/), my guide to simpler deployments. Do check those out üëÄ

## Do you need help with your Django project? 

For the last two decades I've worked on projects for some of the world's largest companies. (And some of the smallest!) 

I'm in a transition since stepping down as Fellow, so now is a good time to talk. If you need help on your Django project, do get in touch.
