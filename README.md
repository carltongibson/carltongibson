### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Carlton Gibson. I work mainly on and with the Django web framework. 

Between 2018 and 2023 I was a **Django Fellow**, and I've spent over a decade maintaining some of the key packages in the Django ecosystem. 

I have a blog on my website, and together with @wsvincent co-host the Django Chat podcast.
