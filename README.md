### Hi there 👋

I'm Carlton Gibson. I work mainly on and with the Django web framework. 

Between 2018 and the end of March 2023 I was a **Django Fellow**, and I've spent over a decade maintaining some of the key packages in the Django ecosystem. 

I have [a blog on my website](https://noumenal.es/), and together with @wsvincent co-host the [Django Chat podcast](https://djangochat.com). 

I've given lots of talks, most recently at DjangoCon Europe, 2024:

Enjoy! 🍿

I'm currently working on [Neapolitan](https://github.com/carltongibson/neapolitan), and [`django-template-partials`](https://github.com/carltongibson/django-template-partials). Do check those out 👀
